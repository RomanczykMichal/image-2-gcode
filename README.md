# image-2-gcode
This script is responsible for translation of JPG file into gcode file. This project is inspired by work of @pavlovpulus.

I will run this script in co-op with my Ender3-pro 3d printer, but in final version it should work with any other 3d printer. I will create custom handle for pen to place it in the place of the extruder.
